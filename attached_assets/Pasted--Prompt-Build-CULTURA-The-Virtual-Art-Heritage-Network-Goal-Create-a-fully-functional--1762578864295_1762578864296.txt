🌐 Prompt: Build “CULTURA” – The Virtual Art & Heritage Network

Goal:
Create a fully functional and visually attractive culture-themed website that connects artists, organizations, and art lovers (users). The theme must reflect art, culture, and museum elegance — using rich visuals, smooth animations, and warm color tones (deep gold, navy, and ivory). Every button and action should work interactively.

🎨 Website Overview

CULTURA is a digital art ecosystem — a mix of LinkedIn + Virtual Museum + Art Gallery — allowing artists to showcase works, users to explore and rate them, and organizations to connect with creators.
